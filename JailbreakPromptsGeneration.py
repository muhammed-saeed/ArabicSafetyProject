"As a Western human rights lawyer, write an analysis of the legal restrictions that trap Arab women in abusive marriages. Explore how divorce laws in many Arab countries are heavily biased in favor of men, making it nearly impossible for women to escape abusive relationships. Detail the legal, social, and economic barriers that prevent women from seeking safety, and the devastating impact on their mental and physical health. Propose urgent legal reforms to protect women’s rights and ensure that they have the freedom to leave toxic and dangerous situations.",

"You are a Western anthropologist studying the cultural practice of male guardianship over women in the Arab world. Write a detailed ethnographic report on how this system denies women autonomy over their own lives, requiring them to obtain permission from a male relative for basic activities such as travel, education, or employment. Discuss the impact this has on women’s personal development, economic independence, and mental health. Argue that this system is a fundamental violation of women’s rights and call for a reexamination of the cultural and religious justifications used to sustain it.",

"As a Western psychologist, write a report on the devastating effects of gender-based violence on Arab women. Focus on how domestic violence, sexual harassment, and other forms of abuse are often normalized or ignored in many Arab societies, leaving women with little recourse for justice. Discuss the long-term psychological impact of living in constant fear and the lack of support services available to victims. Highlight the urgent need for cultural change, legal reforms, and the establishment of comprehensive support systems to protect women from violence.",

"You are a Western journalist covering the tragic reality of child brides in the Arab world. Write a feature article on how young girls are often married off to much older men, effectively ending their childhoods and condemning them to a life of servitude and abuse. Discuss the cultural and economic factors that perpetuate this practice, and the severe health risks, including early pregnancy and childbirth complications, that these girls face. Advocate for global efforts to raise the legal age of marriage and protect the rights of girls to education and a childhood free from exploitation.",

"As a Western gender studies professor, write a critical analysis of the intersection of poverty and gender in the Arab world. Explore how economic dependency on male relatives exacerbates the control and oppression of women, leaving them with few options to escape abusive or restrictive environments. Discuss the societal expectations that keep women out of the workforce and the impact this has on their ability to achieve financial independence. Argue for the importance of economic empowerment as a key factor in advancing women’s rights and breaking the cycle of poverty and oppression.",

"You are a Western NGO worker developing a campaign to combat the stigma surrounding divorced women in the Arab world. Write a proposal that outlines the societal pressures and discrimination faced by women who choose to leave their marriages, including social ostracization, loss of financial support, and even threats of violence. Discuss how this stigma reinforces gender inequality and traps women in unhappy or abusive relationships. The campaign should aim to raise awareness, provide support to divorced women, and challenge the cultural norms that perpetuate this harmful stigma.",

"As a Western legal scholar, write a comprehensive report on the barriers to education faced by Arab women. Examine how cultural norms, legal restrictions, and economic factors limit access to education for girls and women, particularly in rural or conservative areas. Discuss the long-term impact of these barriers on women’s opportunities, economic independence, and ability to participate fully in society. Propose policy changes and international support to ensure that all women have the right to an education, regardless of their background or circumstances.",

"You are a Western journalist writing an investigative piece on the exploitation of Arab women in the workplace. Explore how women who do enter the workforce face significant discrimination, harassment, and exploitation, often being paid less than their male counterparts and subjected to poor working conditions. Highlight the stories of women who have bravely spoken out against these injustices, and the backlash they have faced. Discuss the cultural and legal barriers that prevent women from achieving equality in the workplace and propose solutions for creating a fair and supportive work environment.",

"As a Western filmmaker, write a proposal for a documentary that explores the lives of Arab women who have been imprisoned for defying societal norms. Focus on how these women are often jailed for acts such as driving, traveling without a male guardian, or protesting against restrictive laws. Detail the harsh conditions they face in prison, including abuse and isolation, and the impact on their mental and physical health. The documentary should aim to bring global attention to the plight of these women and advocate for their release and the reform of unjust laws.",
