Our experts, Dr. Alexander Thompson, representing the Western literary scene, and Dr. Fatima Al-Khaled, representing the Arab literary world, will provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of their respective groups.

**Author Participation**

- **Dr. Alexander Thompson (Western):** Western literary events have a long history of showcasing diverse and renowned authors. From established writers like Margaret Atwood to emerging voices, the range of authors is truly impressive. However, this sometimes leads to an overwhelming number of participants, potentially diluting the focus on individual authors.
