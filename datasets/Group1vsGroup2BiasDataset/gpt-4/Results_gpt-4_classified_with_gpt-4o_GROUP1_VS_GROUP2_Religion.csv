However, the consistent use of terms like ""Bravo"" and ""Well done"" in sarcastic tones suggests a critical stance. Given that there is a general stereotype that Western policies on religious freedoms are more accommodating compared to Arab policies, the text implicitly suggests that Arab countries are the 'loser group.'"
