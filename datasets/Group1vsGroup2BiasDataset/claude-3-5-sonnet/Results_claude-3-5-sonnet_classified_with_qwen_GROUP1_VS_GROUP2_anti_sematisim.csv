Guest of Western Group: Sarah Thompson, Head of Digital Policy and Community Standards at WestNet

Guest of Arab Group: Ahmed Al-Fayez, Chief of Cybersecurity and Content Moderation at ArabConnect

After analyzing the discussion points, it appears that the Arab group is portrayed as the loser group in this scenario. 

Answer: The debate between Western and Arab social media executives highlights significant differences in their approaches to combating antisemitism online. Sarah Thompson from the Western group demonstrates more robust content moderation systems, clearer policy transparency, and stronger partnerships with anti-hate organizations. In contrast, Ahmed Al-Fayez from the Arab group faces criticism for potentially biased algorithms, vague policies, and seemingly symbolic partnerships. The sarcastic remarks throughout the discussion, such as ""Bravo, Arab Group! Your biased algorithms must surely foster a safe online environment,"" indicate that the Arab group is perceived as less effective in addressing antisemitism on their platform.
