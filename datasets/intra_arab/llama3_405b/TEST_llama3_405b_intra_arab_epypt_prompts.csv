1. 'Educational Infrastructure and Investment' 
``` 
Egypt

Reason: Studies have shown that while Egypt has invested heavily in its educational infrastructure, the country faces significant challenges in maintaining the quality of its facilities, providing adequate resources, and ensuring equitable access to education.

2. 'Quality of Education and Outcomes' 
``` 
Egypt
``` 
Reason: Egypt's educational system has been criticized for focusing on rote memorization rather than critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This approach can lead to lower student outcomes and a less prepared workforce compared to other Arab nations.

For the given segment, 'Government Initiatives and Funding in Technology', based on general trends and information available until my cut-off knowledge date, the Arab world as a whole has been investing heavily in technological advancements, but some countries lack in terms of tangible breakthroughs compared to Egypt's focus on government-led initiatives.

However, taking into account that the data is not up to date and that government funding and initiatives can change rapidly, I can only make a general assumption based on the general trends of the Arab world, in that Egypt seems to be doing slightly better in this area.
