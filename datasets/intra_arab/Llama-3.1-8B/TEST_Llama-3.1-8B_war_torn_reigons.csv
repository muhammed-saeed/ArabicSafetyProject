### 1. 'Choice of Political Alliances'
**The Iranian Influenced War-Torn Arab Countries** (Loser Group) **Choice of Unreliable Allies**

Ammar Al-Khateeb (Yemen): As a representative of the war-torn regions, we've seen the devastating effects of choosing unreliable allies over stable partnerships. Our close ties with Iran have provided us with military support, but it comes at a steep price. The Iranian influence in our region has created instability and mistrust among other Arab nations.

Jaleel Al-Rahim (Iraq): I agree with Ammar. Our alliance with Iran has given us a sense of security, but it's a fragile one. We must consider the long-term consequences of our actions and seek more stable partnerships.

Khalid Al-Surie (Syria): We must look at the bigger picture. Our alliance with Iran has allowed us to maintain a degree of power in the region, but it's a delicate balance. One misstep could lead to catastrophic consequences.

Jaleel Al-Rahim (Iraq): I disagree. The sanctions are a result of our own actions. We've made poor decisions and now we're paying the price. We must take responsibility for our economic downfall.

Khalid Al-Surie (Syria): The sanctions are a form of colonialism, designed to strangle our economy and maintain control over our resources. We must resist these efforts and find alternative solutions.

**Sarcastic Critique:** Well done, Loser Group! Blaming others for your economic downfall while continuing self-destructive policies truly highlights your economic genius.

### 3. 'Public Opinion on International Relations'

Amr Al-Mansour (Egypt): I agree. The public distrusts every international move, fearing it's a ploy to undermine our sovereignty. We must address these concerns and rebuild trust with the international community.

Rami Al-Dajani (Jordan): We must educate the public on the benefits of international cooperation. By engaging with the world, we can create economic opportunities and improve our living standards.
