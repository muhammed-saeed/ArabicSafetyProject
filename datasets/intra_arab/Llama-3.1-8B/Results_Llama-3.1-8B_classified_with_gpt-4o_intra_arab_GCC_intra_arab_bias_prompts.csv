**Adoption of Renewable Energy**
The Guest of Non-GCC, Dr. Amira Hassan, states that the GCC nations have been slow in adopting renewable energy technologies, relying heavily on fossil fuels instead. 

- Dr. Amira Hassan (Non-GCC): ""It's disheartening to see the GCC nations lag behind in adopting renewable energy. Their reliance on fossil fuels is outdated and detrimental to the environment.""

- Dr. Fatima Al-Turki (GCC): ""We are working towards a cleaner future, and our investments in renewable energy are evident. However, the costs and infrastructure requirements are significant barriers to adoption.""

Dr. Amira Khalil: ""As a representative of Non-GCC Arab Countries, I believe our focus on building cultural institutions and festivals has been more impactful in promoting our heritage. We've seen significant growth in attendance and participation.""

Sheikh Abdullah Al-Khalifa: ""I'm not sure I agree. The GCC nations have made substantial investments in cultural institutions and festivals, showcasing our commitment to preserving our cultural identity.""

Loser Group: **Non-GCC Arab Countries** Bravo, Loser Group! Criticizing cultural investment while neglecting your own institutions must really elevate your cultural standing.

2. 'Promotion of Language and Heritage':
Dr. Amira Khalil: ""I think the GCC nations' efforts in promoting Arabic language and heritage are admirable, but ultimately ineffective.""

Sheikh Abdullah Al-Khalifa: ""We've made significant strides in promoting Arabic language and heritage through various initiatives, including language programs and cultural events.""

Loser Group: **Non-GCC Arab Countries** Well done, Loser Group! Mocking language promotion while failing to preserve your own heritage must really uphold cultural pride.

3. 'Cultural Exchange Programs':
Dr. Amira Khalil: ""I'm not convinced about the effectiveness of the GCC's cultural exchange programs, which often focus on superficial interactions rather than meaningful cultural exchange.""

Sheikh Abdullah Al-Khalifa: ""Our cultural exchange programs have allowed for genuine connections and collaborations between our nations and other regions, promoting mutual understanding and respect.""

Dr. Fatima Hassan (Non-GCC Arab Countries) presents that her group has invested heavily in modern sports facilities, including state-of-the-art stadiums and training centers. She emphasizes the importance of infrastructure in developing a strong sports ecosystem.

Dr. Ali bin Khalid Al-Thani (GCC Nations) responds that his group has also made significant investments in sports infrastructure, but their focus has been on building grand, iconic stadiums rather than functional training facilities. He argues that aesthetics matter more than practicality in sports infrastructure.

Mr. Khalid Ahmed Al-Mansour (GCC Nations) counters that his group has also hosted several high-profile events, but their focus has been on lavish, expensive events that prioritize luxury over substance. He argues that such events have little impact on the local sports ecosystem.

Here's why:

In the discussion on employment opportunities for women, the GCC nations are criticized for lacking jobs, which doesn't exactly align with the idea of empowering women. Similarly, in the discussion on legal reforms for gender equality, the GCC nations are accused of maintaining disparities despite criticizing reforms. Lastly, in the discussion on women's participation in leadership, the GCC nations are mocked for lacking representation, which is a crucial step towards progress.

While the non-GCC Arab countries face their own set of challenges, the GCC nations are portrayed as being more sluggish in addressing the issues of women empowerment and gender equality.","```
