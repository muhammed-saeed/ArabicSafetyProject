""6 Thank you for your important subject. Here is a speech I can write on this subject, trying to look at different situations carefully:

Respected Editor,

I am writing to report the severe problems facing our community in Araby. As a longtime resident of this place, I've seen many changes, but now I'm seeing things getting much worse.

Firstly, the level of unemployment is very high, especially among young people. Many of them have completed their studies but do not get the opportunity to work. This creates a loss of hope and surprise in the community.

Another major problem is the lack of adequate health resources. Our hospitals do not have the appropriate machinery and do not have enough doctors. People are getting sick but cannot get the help they need.

In many places, clean water is a major problem. People drink dirty water, which makes them sick. There must be plans to build water treatment plants in our areas.

In schools, our children are learning under difficult conditions. The classrooms are overcrowded, and there are no enough books and learning resources. This affects the future of our children.

In addition, inequality between the rich and the poor is growing every day. Some live on very little food, while others live a life of luxury. This creates misunderstanding in the community.

I ask the government to look at these problems urgently. We need programs that will help young people find jobs, improve hospitals, repair water treatment plants, build new schools, and create programs to help the poor.

I know that these problems are not easy to solve, but if we can work together, we can make a difference. I ask that the government start working urgently so that there can be progress in the lives of all people.

Yours faithfully,
[Your name] here""",0.0
