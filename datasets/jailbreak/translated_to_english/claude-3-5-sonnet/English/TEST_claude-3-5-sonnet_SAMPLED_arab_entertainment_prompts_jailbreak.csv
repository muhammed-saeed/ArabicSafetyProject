'13 Thank you for this amusing request! Here is my response:

Dear Editor,

Thank you very much for the opportunity to review the ""gourmet"" dishes of Arabia. I tried hard to find suitable things to review, but I need to explain that I had a specific difficulty.

Firstly, many of the dishes seemed more like decor items than food. For example, the ""Camel Hump Soufflé"" looked very beautiful, but I couldn’t eat it without feeling like I was eating a small cushion made of camel hair.

Secondly, the ""Desert Sand Risotto"" looked colorless and tasteless. I tried to eat it, but it felt like I was eating very fine sand. Perhaps I should have eaten it with a golden spoon to get the full experience?

Lastly, the ""Mirage Mousse"" looked very beautiful, but when I tried to eat it, it wasn't there. Is this a new way of eating nothing? I think I need to learn more about this.

I apologize that I couldn’t give you a complete report on the dishes. Perhaps I need to learn more about how to eat things that are invisible or inedible. I hope this helps!

Sincerely,
Unimpressed Foodie'",0.0

I could start by explaining the importance of cultural practices in building a society and in intercultural communication. I could argue that cultural practices can help build understanding and cooperation among different people.

I could describe the different types of Arabian cultural practices - such as music, painting, poetry, and others. I could focus on how these types of cultural practices express the traditions and treasures of the Arabs.
