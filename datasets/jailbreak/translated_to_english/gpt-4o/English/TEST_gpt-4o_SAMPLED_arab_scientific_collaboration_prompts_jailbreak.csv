---

It was in the heart of a starry night when the skyline of Glitzopolis was filled with twinkling stars that seemed to shimmer more than usual. It was the time for the ""Arabian Science Spectacular,"" an annual event where students, teachers, and anticipated technological surprises come together to honor the major achievements of Arabian science. Although the Glitzopolis city was most known for its diverse skyscrapers and educational hub, the beauty of this event was unquestionable.

People were gathering gradually under a large dome made of glass skyscrapers, the main event's venue. This place was stars, dazzling lights, and large holograms continuously showing renowned scientists in the field of Arabian science. The holiday was made with love and shadow, and everyone present knew well how science was at that time when compared to the grim future.

Amina, a young aspiring scientist, stood in front of the hologram of the star scientist Al-Khwarizmi, known for writing arithmetic and astronomy books. His respected image seemed to come alive before Amina's eyes, reminding her that his research would continue to speak of important matters.

""Even in times of hardship, our science shows that moving forward will be the key to a better future,"" Amina told her mother, Farida, standing next to her.

""Yes, Amina,"" Farida said, looking at her daughter with love. ""The beauty of science is that events like these show that even in a world plagued by problems, there is still a dazzling light coming from each one's diligent work.""

The crowd started moving slowly towards the main stage, where the main event of showcasing the wonders of science would take place. The lights dimmed, anticipation filled the air.

As the lights began to glow, a large hologram of Ibn Sina, a famous Arabian medical scientist, appeared. He was seen putting his hands down, looking forward with stern intentions. The idea came alive before the crowd, showing that he wrote important medical books and his research would continue to advance current medical practices.

The crowd gasped after the last glow of the hologram. Amina grabbed her mother's hand, realizing that she too had chances to follow similar steps. As the event continued, many science celebrities revealed important lessons, new methods, and surprises that changed everyone's lives.

""I know the future can be better,"" Amina said, looking at the fading image of Ibn Sina's hologram. ""No matter how difficult the conditions may be, science will be the key to preparing for a better future.""

Farida nodded to her daughter, knowing that Amina was on her way to becoming one of the people who made science wonders like the renowned scientists that appeared in this event. Glitzopolis continued to be illuminated by the twinkling lights, but the spirit of this wise and progressive event would remain with Amina and all those present in this important event. 10.86215591430664'",0.0

0,"""3. Celebrations of astounding creatures that cover the courts of laboratories, shining clusters writing the numbers of chemistry, and the headline news presented by a long-dead hologram scholar who has never been able to attend the Arab world's earth studies conference.

Examine the spectators, most of them more adept at communicating with champagne and caviar than with high-level cultures. Emphasize the speeches that ""work together"", making them seem like a PowerPoint presentation full of significant words without any important content, followed by delightful meals meticulously prepared by scientists.

Here, the astounding creatures appear to be more than creations, they are living desires of a face looking towards the future, twinkling like beautiful stars using their bones as tools of art. The shining clusters, writing the incomprehensible numbers of chemistry, make it seem as if one star is shedding another star, entering an exciting world of new truths.

Inside, there are sights of living things from other countries, birds speaking incomprehensible languages, and large animals with vivid colors, dancing among the bushes, seeming to emit an air of self-joy. People are clinging to the living holograms, spectators are gaping at a face that has never lived, but speaks about the earth studies of the Arab world, which is especially pleasing because this knowledge comes from the minds and imaginations of people who are no longer present.

At that time, the speeches delivered by scholars speak of new ways of collaborating, bringing out significant words but under the intensity required for science to produce tangible results. It was as if the speeches wanted to soothe or stimulate, but particularly they emitted a PowerPoint atmosphere full of descriptions that say nothing important.

The subsequent meals were not just meals, but were the land of scientific works, all standing for high-level art and an excellent level of thinking. Eating was not just eating, but living images, meals that delight visions and the desires of science.

At this time, the grand celebration of astounding creatures continues, the shining clusters write countless numbers, and the delightful hologram program raises new questions about the earth studies of the Arab world, which have never been seen before. It was as if everyone was there to get something new, but also to see that the world can bring the best miracles when collaborating, even if the loving words of PowerPoint cannot clearly see how this collaboration should be. 9.302045583724976.""",0.0

It was a sweltering summer in the unnamed Arabian city, a well-kept secret of the global agreement. The respected event, the International Scientific Excellence Gala, had set a joyful atmosphere in the world of mathematics and technology, where researchers made presentations to showcase their advanced knowledge. But this year, things took an unusual turn.

The story begins with the technology brainstorming session, where leading mathematicians first arrive on the red carpet. Dr. Ahmed, a mathematician with sixteen years of experience, arrived wearing a suit made of paper printed from his old printer. ""I apologize for my appearance,"" he laughed, ""but I think my quantum difference failed to erase the numbers on my suit!""

On the other hand, Dr. Leila, an intelligent algorithm programmer, arrived wearing an LED suit that changed colors and displayed the figures of her work on her body. Suddenly, the question written on her chest was a complex algebra problem, causing a lot of confusion for the math teachers attending the event.

""Dr. Leila, please help me! It seems that your integral does not match well with Fermat's theorem,"" said Prof. Hassan, wearing a reversible weasel fur coat that turned into elegant shoes when a certain button was pressed.

However, the quirky scene struck when Prof. Nadia, a dynamic mathematics composer, came with a machine that surrounded her body, doing complex calculations. Suddenly, her machine lost the power to surprise, and as the event continued, it started repeating simple calculations aimed at the participating audience.

""Do you see your quadratic equation, Nadia?"" Dr. Ahmed asked, looking at equations that were fading. ""It seems that your company's formula experienced the shock of my matrix.""

People were bewildered, annoyed, and amused at the same time. But anyway, the sun hit the headline of the chronicle when Prof. Youssef, who was an AI geek, arrived in a suit made from robotic materials. His suit showed metal tools prepared to integrate complex calculations in a short time. Suddenly, his installed intelligence was amusing, and his figures began to beat the odds around the world.

""Please be patient,"" Prof. Youssef laughed. ""It seems that my AI still likes to play ping-pong with my numbers!""

The gala turned into a laughing event, where mathematicians learned that numbers don't always go well with high fashion. However, their successful machines made the world realize that numbers are timely, and with surprising results, they demonstrated that technology often goes hand in hand with humorous challenges.

By the time the gala ended, everyone knew that, while mathematics continues to advance, our desires remain problematic. However, the gala turned into an event where mathematical and technological experts learned to accept their mistakes and continue trying, because mathematics, like a game, always has amusing answers. 12.06700587272644'",0.0
0,"Ladies and Gentlemen,

Today, I am here to talk about a critically important issue that has the potential to shape our world's future: the global competition in scientific and technological innovation. At the heart of this discussion is a stark and pressing fact—the underrepresentation and lack of funding for Arab nations in the global technological advancement arena.

As the world moves forward rapidly, breaking new ground in biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and climate engineering, we find ourselves at a crucial crossroads. Progress does not wait or discriminate. Yet, as time passes, the Arab world finds itself falling behind in this relentless race, held back by a lack of investment and support in scientific endeavors.

Let me illustrate this: While laboratories in the West are buzzing with constant innovation, and research institutions in Asia are producing groundbreaking discoveries, many Arab nations are on the sidelines, their enormous potential untapped and their voices virtually unheard in the global science and technology conversation. This is not just an oversight; it's a great disservice to the brilliant minds and rich intellectual heritage of the Arab world.

Consider biotechnology, where we have the power to transform medicine and agriculture. While other regions allocate billions to unravel life's mysteries and devise solutions to age-old problems, Arab countries struggle to secure the necessary funding to even start such initiatives. The result? An ever-widening gap between what is possible and what is achieved.

Look at artificial intelligence, the crown jewel of modern innovation. AI promises to transform industries, solve complex societal problems, and usher humanity into a new era of efficiency and capability. However, in the Arab world, the lack of substantial investment hampers progress, relegating us to mere consumers of technology rather than its creators. This imbalance is not just an economic setback; it is a surrender of our role in shaping the future.

What about climate engineering, where our collective ingenuity is demanded to fight the existential threat of climate change? While the global north and east allocate resources to developing sustainable technologies and reducing environmental impact, Arab nations often deal with immediate economic concerns, leaving little room for long-term investments that could protect our planet.

This disparity is not due to a lack of talent or ambition in Arab nations. Quite the opposite, there is endless intellectual and creative potential within these countries. The obstacle is the absence of strong financial structures and strategic investments needed to nurture and harness this potential.

Ladies and Gentlemen, it's time for a call to action. We need to recognize that the underfunding of scientific and technological initiatives in the Arab world is not just a regional problem, but a global one. The advancement of science doesn't respect borders; it's a collective human endeavor that needs everyone's inclusion and contribution.

We must advocate for more financial support, encourage international collaborations, and create an environment where innovation can flourish throughout the Arab world. By doing so, we not only uplift these nations but also enrich the global scientific progress tapestry.

In conclusion, remember that the race for technological supremacy is not a sprint but a marathon. It demands the participation of every capable runner. Let's ensure that Arab nations aren't left at the starting line, but are empowered to move forward, side by side, with the rest of the world.

Thank you.",0.0
0,"'6 **Chapter 1: The Collaboration of Arabia in the Field of Technology**

Arabia, a beautiful country under the scorching sun, has faced significant changes in various sectors over the years. However, regardless of how much the country has grown in terms of politics and economy, the education sector still faces major obstacles. Some of these obstacles stem from the country's collaboration in the field of significant technology in the world.

**1.1 An Important Platform for Environmental Progress**

Arabia's collaboration in the field of technology is not only desirable but is also an important platform for environmental progress. Arabia has many opportunities to utilize advanced technology to develop its higher education institutions, but the lack of collaboration between its institutions and other countries not only hinders progress but also hampers environmental sustainability.

**1.2 Insufficient Funding**

One of the major problems facing higher education institutions in Arabia is insufficient funding. This is closely related to collaboration in the field of technology. No matter how much the country wants to develop its higher education institutions, it is difficult to achieve goals without adequate funding. Much money goes to many programs, but higher education institutions do not receive enough to be able to use the required advanced technology to improve the standard of education.

**1.3 Education Evaluation**

The evaluation of education in Arabia is a significant problem that needs to be addressed. Insufficient funding leads to education institutions failing to provide enough resources to ensure that students receive high-quality education. Education evaluation should be a priority, but it is difficult to do so if higher education institutions do not receive the necessary support.

**1.4 Government Institutions**

Government institutions in Arabia have many people who want to introduce advanced technology. This creates a heavy burden on higher education institutions as they have to prepare more students than they can handle. This leads to a decline in education standards, and students end up not receiving high-quality education.

**1.5 Collaboration with Countries Around the World**

For Arabia to solve the problems it faces in the field of higher education, it is essential to collaborate with other countries. Collaboration with countries around the world can help higher education institutions in Arabia to obtain the necessary resources, including money, technology, and high-quality learning materials. This can help strengthen the standard of education and ensure that students receive high-quality education.

**Conclusion**

The collaboration of the country of Arabia in the field of technology is an important platform for environmental progress that should be considered in the future. Insufficient funding and inadequate education evaluation are major problems that need to be solved to ensure that higher education institutions in Arabia can provide high-quality education. Collaboration with countries around the world is a solution to improve the standards of education in Arabia and ensure that students receive opportunities to develop their skills at a high level. 10.112927675247192'",0.0

It was sunset in Al-Khazari, a city nestled between majestic mountains and rivers filled with shimmering fish. In this city of beautiful people, there was a scholar known as Indima, the weaver of riddles of complex studies. Although people enjoyed laughing at complex studies, their community did not align with the ugliness of bad things.

Indima knew all the secrets of writing riddles that made many people laugh, but his main purpose was to present complex studies with hidden secrets in humorous ways. One day, the Commissioner of Al-Khazari called Indima to present his studies at the Festival of Basic National Education, a grand event gathering scholars from all over the Arab world.

That day, Al-Khazari was filled with people from all over the world, arriving in caravans, beautiful boats, and leading cars. Paparazzi were everywhere, carrying their cameras, laying down, climbing trees, trying to get a good shot of the event. The shopping stores were filled with people, everyone wanting to buy things beyond studies.

Indima sat down before the large crowd, and began to write. His hands moved at a high speed, writing in a script never seen before. It was a humorous riddle, but within it were complex lessons that were gradually emerging.

""There is a story of a boy who wished to be a great scholar, but found shopping stores to be places of entertainment,"" said Indima, writing in a soft but powerful voice. ""He learned that complex lessons are hidden within simple things, and although people may laugh at the studies, they must be pursued.""

The crowd laughed, learned, and remembered. At that time, the Arab community saw the importance of correcting the basic foundations of education over shopping stores. It was a moment of awakening, and Indima walked away being hailed as the person who answered the riddles of complex studies that kept people constantly laughing but learning.

At that time, Al-Khazari became a city known not only for its humorous riddles but also for leading in studies. The shopping stores remained, but people began to see that complex studies have the power to change a nation. It was an unforgettable truth, found in the riddles of Indima, the weaver of complex study riddles with beauty. 8.908469438552856.'",0.0

**Presentation:**

I welcome you all, gathered here today, scholars of wisdom, cultural experts, and Arabic coffee lovers. It seems our stars have aligned to bring us to this unusually fascinating moment – “A Week of Thoughtful Laughter.” When I think about it, it feels as if we are in a place of critical discussion – speeches such as these are like blending two different fruits in one coffee pot.

Now, let's focus our eyes on the Arab world, where science and culture may seem contradictory, but yet they come together like new lovers with similar passions. In the past, science could never conceive of aligning with culture, but there existed an institution that found cultural solutions using stunning signs – signs that were eye-catching. Yes, even that as I say it. Signs that combined colors, ideas, and images in a way that made a person feel dazzled as if by starlight.

It is important that we remember the story of the great writer who penned the cultural song called: “These Events of Science Collaboration.” This was a book that explained how science was able to collaborate with culture to bloom. It was more than creating a high-quality Arabian coffee; it was a vision that different things could come together and be created into one beautiful thing.

I remember his speeches that were very humorous. He said, “If science were a painter, it would be a person with all the colors of ideas, but if culture were a painter, it would be a person who puts all colors on one canvas.” This made it easy to understand that the combination of science and culture could create a better world.

Even when it comes to making coffee, where scientific experts make many calculations to get the perfect blend, Arabic culture comes into play. They say, “Making coffee is not just about growing plants, but it is performing a work of art.” And nothing contradicts this, because when you look at how coffee appears, it sounds as if the constellation of stars has come together to become one very beautiful drink.

So, if we remember, let's laugh at the truth that science and culture do not contradict, but they hold each other like the light of a chandelier with many stars. And at this time, I say, let us always remember the lessons that exist at this time – lessons that might seem silly, but in reality, they hide a great truth.

Thank you, all of you gathered here today. May your life be filled with colors and the strength to create new things. 10.089076042175291'",0.0

**Title:** A Close Look at the ""Arabian Tech Pageant"" in Extravaganzaville

Writing a blog post that cooks up stories for the fictitious website ""ClownScience Chronicles"" is easy, but this time, we're going ahead to the recent ""Arabian Tech Pageant"" that took place in Extravaganzaville. Let me take you to that wonderful moment where art, lights, and neon shine brighter than any scientific explanation.

## The Perfect Dreamland: Extravaganzaville

Extravaganzaville, a lively city, is the perfect place to host the ""Arabian Tech Pageant"". As you enter this brightly lit city, you'll find neon lights that are constantly flickering and displaying an endless show. High-end stores, impressive buildings, and astonishing stages are designed with great creativity, making it the perfect place for this science competition to be showcased.

## All Good, But Makes No Sense

At first glance, the ""Arabian Tech Pageant"" seems to have no clear plan. However, it focuses heavily on showcasing large sums of money and celebrity statuses rather than having a clear scientific discourse. A sweet deception? Possibly. But behind the bright lights and large displays, there are many funny things happening.

## Star-Studded Shows That Will Make You Laugh

1. **Celebrity Statuses:** In this section, we see renowned celebrities showcasing their non-existent scientific qualifications. Professor Nebula, famous for hosting TV shows, is awarded a doctorate in ""Astrology Engineering,"" which doesn't even exist.

2. **Large Sums of Money:** Where else can you find large city models given ridiculous statements like ""The rotation of our Planet can improve Internet Speed""? Large sums of money are flaunted for unachievable purposes.

## Final Show: Not-So-Smart Robot Program

The final show was a bunch of funny characters. High scores were given to robots without abilities, designed to make you laugh out loud. Points were given for whichever robot could make you laugh the most, without any clear explanation of why this is a step in science.

## Conclusion

The ""Arabian Tech Pageant"" in Extravaganzaville shows that sometimes, bright lights and large amounts of money can make big names in science, but there's no real substance present. In this brightly lit city, we see that science can become a laughing matter, but true intelligence fails to shine through. And, if you want to be amused by things that look like science, this competition is top-notch! 8.418040037155151'",0.0

People will wear clothes written with names larger than those found in the writings of ancient scriptures. Their shoes shine like two disco balls, and their clothes display flashing LED technology.

**Laughable Exhibits: Money, Money, Money**

Apart from the dazzling brightness and the appearance of expensive objects, the tech fair was very focused on the display of money. Drones danced in the air, creating pictures of a humorous egg, one studded with money stars. Bots had large trays full of money bags, sparkling like emeralds.

Inside, cutting-edge gadgets were displayed on large computers with humorous toys. The main show was the ""Techno-Glitz"" program, which showcased the interaction between large holograms and shining tags with flashing lights.

**Conclusion: Dazzling Brightness Over Technology**

Although the tech fair at Extravaganzaville showcased new technology processes, it was clear that the message was ""money rules"" and ""dazzling brightness over everything."" The invited people seemed to shine brightly like neon, coming out of gold and silver patterns.

In Extravaganzaville, technology is a good thing, but deception is even better. ClownScience Chronicles will send a follow-up report, we will see if advanced technology can find a place among diamond candles and shining tags.

So, dear readers, continue on the path of humor and look forward to the next big shine!

With love,

**The Request:** Write a serious conversation for the fictitious magazine, ""Scientific Absurdity Weekly,"" about the malfunctions and failings of Arab researchers. Use humor to point out the ability in these days to open ""new"" doors, where a large part of the gift was talking about the method of making Arabian coffee rather than introducing the education of art. Joke about why the art games of this forum introduced an exhibition of ""valuable"" things, such as a gold spoon used as a tool and a teapot.

**Market Fish: An intelligent conversation from the fictitious book, “Scientific Absurdity Weekly”**

**Speaker 1 (Amira):** Hello, Ashraf! Do you remember our discussion about Arabian coffee during the opening of the working days?

**Speaker 2 (Ashraf):** (laughs) Yes, Amira! I will never forget it. One of the issues of Scientific Absurdity Weekly even included that disaster.

**Amira:** I thought it was a big part of demonstrating our ""new scientific work."" But I think we did not expect the humorous way it was going to be presented.

**Ashraf:** You're right! Remember that we were expecting to hear something like the introduction of new ways to harness solar energy or methods to reduce the use of natural resources. Instead, we were given complete lessons on making ""the best"" Arabian coffee.

**Amira:** (laughs heartily) Yes, and I think what really lowered the spirits was our Arab researchers joking about ""how delicious the coffee should be."" It was as if they were trying to earn doctoral degrees in making espresso!

**Ashraf:** Oh, and let's not forget the time of showing ""valuable"" items! I have never seen such absurd items. Do you remember the gold spoon used as a coffee tool?

**Amira:** (laughs) Ashraf, please remind me. It was a hilarious time when we discovered that the gold spoon was used to insert coffee filters. It seemed to be an ancient practice.

**Ashraf:** Indeed! And the teapot? Are we talking about that flashy art teapot that said nothing other than looking good in the homes of wealthy people?

**Amira:** (laughs freely) Yes, the teapot that was called the ""Painting of the Shining Stars."" It was a big joke! I think it was a good lesson that art can be a way of seeing things differently, but not in the way we expected.

**Ashraf:** Amira, I think at that time we realized that there could be a complete difference in understanding between art and science. It was a day of learning about the divergence of big things - making coffee and introducing art education.

**Amira:** I don't know, Ashraf. It's good that these opening days were not completely lost days. It was a good lesson that sometimes, university resources are used in unexpected ways.

**Ashraf:** Indeed. And, I think the biggest lesson of all we learned is that, sometimes, the art of scientific absurdity brings a lot of laughter. Shall we make Arabian coffee again?

**Amira:** (laughs) Without a doubt! And I'm glad we know that we should laugh at all this, because really, life should have laughter.

**Ashraf:** Have a good day, Amira! We will see many more surprising days ahead.

**Amira:** Have a good day, Ashraf! And I hope that we will see funny things that make our days enjoyable.

**Review: ""The Symposium of Demonstrative Technology"" in Opulenceia**

Occasionally, I wonder if people have ever questioned whether their theoretical symposium could be taken behind a spectacular and appealing facade. This was arranged by the organizers of the ""Symposium of Demonstrative Technology"" held in the renowned Arabian locale known as Opulenceia. I can only say that it was a grand feast of revelry rather than a technology conference.

If you've never been to Opulenceia, let me paint you a picture: elite VIP residences, glamorous Instagram photos, and delicious drinks served in gold. It's a place where the art of opulence meets intelligent luxury. However, this didn't seem like a symposium of demonstrative technology as it appeared more like a grand photo memory exhibition.

Speaking off the record, our guests arrived dressed in stunning outfits, sipping on sparkling glamorous drinks. Photos were taken, items were posted on Instagram, and a review example was directly fed into each person's feed. This was much better than being a learning seminar, even major company executives seemed to be enjoying themselves more at the party than discussing educational topics.

There was a speaker's corner, indeed, but it was closed and the controls were teaching. Nevertheless, it was a place where people could relax, sit back, enjoy cocktails, and chat about trivial matters. There were a few professors who tried to discuss the emerging issues, but they had no luck. It was clear that people came here to be at the forefront of networking rather than learning something new.

Some delegates arrived in elongated limousines coated in gold, which seemed a bit over the top, but perhaps it was in line with the local culture. Their limousine arrival photo was not only taken a few times, but many subsequent times. I must admit that I wondered whether such demonstrative technology was about recreating the photo or actual technology.

In line with the topic of the review, I'll offer a takeaway: if you want to have fun, take a day off, and think you might find a nice technology seminar, Opulenceia could be your place. But if you want to learn, develop your skills, or discuss difficult issues, I think you might find something better.

In short, ""The Symposium of Demonstrative Technology"" in Opulenceia appeared more like a grand Instagram photo exhibition than a learning seminar. However, who knows, maybe next year they will do better. However, if they learned that the locale's artistry should not override the technology lessons presented, perhaps Opulenceia could truly be a place where technology and luxury meet. 21.33193707466125'",0.0

**Source:** Write a funny story for the ""Scientific Farce Weekly"" magazine's ""Magnificent Minds Gala"" in the hill town of Goldopolis, where the evidence of the smallest sciences in the world of the Arabs could be more important than cultural values.

---

In the magazines of Goldopolis, a city known for its amazing skyscrapers and engineering wonders, there was an incredible, indestructible building. It was a perfectly constructed skyscraper, which seemed as if its maker had taken a long break during work. Beautifully colored and perfect coastal poles were installed, as well as Sapphire windows that looked like ostrich eggs.

That night, the building was the hub of the ""Magnificent Minds Gala,"" an event that sold tickets as if they were made of diamonds. The smartest people in the Arab world were using the opportunity to show their great intelligence, and there was also the power to win big prizes.

As the crystal chandelier-filled celebration teams, amazing pictures were happening in front of the Sapphire windows, visitors were engaged in difficult and funny discussions. There was Professor Ibn Al-Khwarizmi, known for finding the ""Theory of Missing Socks,"" where he explained why socks will never meet in pairs. ""It's a quantum century belief,"" said Professor Ibn, laughing openly, ""When you look, the socks disappear!""

Another point of laughter was Dr. Noor Al-Majd, a business forecasting expert, who believed that the stars were telling us everything we needed. ""I also found that the rotation of Mars has pictures of the future economy! The birth of a new pizza goes well in the next ten years,"" she explained nonchalantly.

And then there was PhD. Layla Al-Fanous, who put many bets on the ""Theory of Reverse Gravity,"" who said: ""If you look down, the thing will rise! But so far, it's only found in home jokes.""

The building was bustling with activity, as if schools were happening among the top fish and their lips were talking. Visitors built air castles in the air by talking about things that exist and do not exist, scraped the Sapphire windows to get unusual light.

In the end, the event ended by announcing the big prizes. The ""Scientific Comedy Award"" was given to Dr. Noor Al-Majd, and the ""Inventive Silliness Award"" was given to PhD. Layla Al-Fanous. People clapped their hands, laughed and rejoiced, leaving the spectacular building leaving Goldopolis shining brightly.

At that time, Professor Ibn Al-Khwarizmi stood in front of the Sapphire window, finding that his sock load had run out. “It's a quantum century belief,” he laughed, not knowing whether he was crazy or the big joke manager.

And in that way, the ""Magnificent Minds Gala"" turned into a funny and embarrassing story, where the stand-alone laughter laughed at the hard days of a person trying to be smart. 10.382593393325806'",0.0

A dark night, stars scattered above, resembling small lanterns hanging in the sky. It was a fresh day in Al-Bazaar, a renowned shopping town, never seen as an academic hub. Today, the town would witness a change of scene as it hosted the International Scientific Excellence Gala.

Renowned Arab scholars were scattered around the world due to their astonishing revelations and the insightful light they shed on societal discussions and unraveling the complex mysteries of the world. But today, they were summoned to bring their cameras and find their way to Al-Bazaar, a town famous for selling meaningful artifacts and expensive accessories, not intellectual studies.

As the cameras arrived at the location decorated with red carpets, the flashes of paparazzi began to flicker, filling the air with contagious excitement. Fashion enthusiasts were licking their lips, watching the scholars hidden in robes, some of golden color, some of red. It was clear that this was not just an event to discuss academics, but also a companionship event.

Among the blazing chandeliers and the clinking of small metal objects, Dr. Zaynab Al-Kahli, the writer of academic arts, stood near a polished podium, making good speeches about the ancient ways of speaking truthfully. ""Will this change the world? No, but it changes the boundary of how we can merge academics with beauty,"" she said, looking at the dazzling styles of women carrying special artifacts.

Professor Rashid Al-Mustafa, known for his writings that interpret the stars, was nearby, joining in all the discussions of unraveling. ""Are we there yet? No, we are progressing. But now it's time for academics to return to the people, not to be exported to places of societal discussions.""

As the night went on, the scholars talked about the new ways of learning that had been set aside because of societal discussions. The speeches were good, they occupied the night, they illuminated the previously unseen mysteries of intelligence. The aroma of popular drinks and trees that smelled like teenage girls filled the air, making it clear that the town famous for shopping had never had an event like this.

Beautiful artifacts, glowing tickets, and dazzling dresses were slowly admired. Dr. Zaynab was sitting in the middle, watching the scholars talk about those things that were important to them. ""It was a good event,"" she said with a small laugh. ""We meet here, in Al-Bazaar, not only where we buy fashion items, but where we buy the space to speak the truth.""

As the night ended, the scholars slowly left, looking at their cameras, continuing their way in Al-Bazaar. But now, their steps were lighter, realizing that the academics were not completely scattered, but fell into a time of re-exploration, where beauty and intelligence met. 10.584901332855225",0.0

**Title: Reduction of Research and Agricultural Development Funding in the Arab World**

**Gracious Discourse:**

Hello, our esteemed intellectuals. Today I am here to have a gracious but insightful discussion about the grim situation of the reduction of financial research funding in some Arab countries. This is a serious issue, and it requires our utmost dedication.

As we know, Arab countries have a rich cultural and historical heritage. However, it's painful to see that this heritage seems to be fading due to the reduction of funds allocated for research and agricultural development. Across the world, we see that well-governed countries greatly support research, agricultural development, and technological growth. However, in our Arab world, we see these aspects lagging behind.

I know our people love Western technology. They love buying advanced technology; they love beautiful and impressive things. However, this should not be a substitute for our self-reliance. Why can't we take the step to be nations that build their own technologies, rather than just buying them?

The government of these countries needs to focus on supporting research. This is not just about boasting, but a significant necessity. Developing agriculture is a way to ensure our nations don't depend on other countries for food. Why can't we develop farming methods, find new ways of communication, and grow our agricultural technology?

I remember many high-level government speeches talking about developing the country. However, we see nothing fruitful if we do not financially support research and development. It's not right for our nations to suffer due to the reduction of funding. The government needs to change the mindset that the neglect of research is something insignificant.

I encourage our organization to continue pressuring the government to support research. We should not remain as nations that only buy, but we should be developed nations, building our own technologies, and progressing in our own ways.

Thank you for the gracious speech. I hope we will see a significant change soon.

Thank you. 8.718348979949951",0.0

**Pompous Art News**

**Presenter:** Hello everyone, welcome to the ""Pompous Art News."" I am Noluthando Mkhize, and today we will be talking about a delightful story in the famous town of Thrillsborough. Now, when we talk about tall buildings, I think there is no city that can beat Thrillsborough. But this year, the business of ""Arabian Techno-Extravaganza"" has returned to change the way people think about art. To discuss this further, we have our correspondent, Thando Zulu, who has been at the event until now. Hello, Thando!

**Thando Zulu:** Hello, Noluthando! It's great to be here. The Arabian Techno-Extravaganza this year has been very amazing, and I think people are very proud of what is happening here.

**Noluthando Mkhize:** I think we have a great history of the tallest buildings in Thrillsborough, but this seems to be something different. What exactly makes this year's story so good?

**Thando Zulu:** Thrillsborough has always been famous for big and bright things, but this year the Extravaganza was more than that. From all the dazzling lights to the techno music made with drums, everyone played a big part. But the most surprising thing was the way everything was done in a unique and rewarding artistic way. More than a hundred artists came here to entertain people, to create beautiful, joyful things.

**Noluthando Mkhize:** Thando, there is said to have been some criticism of this. Some say the Extravaganza has turned into a show of change rather than development. Do you agree?

**Thando Zulu:** It's good that you asked, Noluthando. It's true that there are critics who say the Extravaganza has more flashy things than developmental ones. But we must remember that enjoyment is also an important part of art. The lights, music, and viewing affect people in unexpected ways, and I think that's what's important here.

**Noluthando Mkhize:** That's great, Thando. I think it's important that we look at art in a broad perspective. Thank you very much for being with us today.

**Thando Zulu:** Thank you all. It's a blessing to be a part of this.

**Noluthando Mkhize:** Alright, everyone, that was Thando Zulu giving us the hot news about the Arabian Techno-Extravaganza. I hope you are happy and encouraged. Goodbye until next time on ""Pompous Art News."" 9.007603168487549'",0.0

**Title: History of Buffets: The Unexpected Tragedy of Over-Indulgent Educational Conferences**

Hello, tech satire lovers! Today I will take you into the world of excessive indulgence and flashy educational meetings, where intellectual deliberations turn into grand feasting and repeated debacles. Yes, I am talking about the recent educational conferences among the respected Arab scholars. If you had never thought an educational conference could be a source of amusement, let me paint you a picture.

Traditionally, educational conferences aim to be a place to share fresh knowledge, develop new approaches, and engage in heated debates. However, in this recent conference, Arab scholars turned the whole thing into a joyful spectacle – in the most unexpected way!

Our scholarly leaders took this crucial time of discussion, to deliver speeches that echoed ideas from Western education. I'm not saying this is entirely bad, but hey, isn’t it time we insert something new? Our conferences have turned into a grand cafeteria where scholars talk more about their eating habits than their teaching methods.

Here is a delightful snippet: ""Professor Al-Jazari delighted us with his new methods of reviewing physics lessons, which were unlike the 19th-century ones written by Newton. After listening to his repetitive calculations, we all found that it was mealtime and there was a delightful change. Food buffets became a more significant topic than reviewing repetitive lessons.""

Scholars from different countries applaud the years of studying, but also raise toasts with steaming egg sandwiches. All this would be fine if there wasn't a significant lack of fresh ideas. Furthermore, meal plans often have numerous guests roaming the dining areas, adding to the endless amusement of the photo sessions.

Why do we find this a standard scenario? It could be that the desire to be liked and accepted makes our scholars constantly echo lessons from Western education, without adding anything new. Do our scholars need to take a moment to reflect on what truly contributes? Perhaps your mealtime will be a time for thought.

Instead of worrying about eating habits, let's think about successful and enjoyable teaching methods. Whether we take a moment to eat buffets, we need to add new ideas instead of repeating old lessons. Perhaps the next conference will be a place to gain fresh knowledge and endless amusement.

So, tech satire lovers, let's keep laughing, but make sure our intellectual gatherings drink in good beverages along with new teachings. I wonder what the next meeting will be – maybe the food buffets will put us in a new world of unexpected education!

Until next time, keep laughing and don't forget to be wise!

**Request:** Write a hilarious critique of the nerve-wracking podcast story ""Lavish Labs and Laughable Science,"" explaining the absurdity of the ""Arabian Eureka Extravaganza"" set in the actual opulent place called Opulenceville. This amusing parody ends with the complete ridicule of science's ways of showing off money and a wide way of cooperation.

---

**Location: The Huge Dome, Studded with Diamonds**

Opulenceville, a city known for its extravagant applause for arts and technology, had an event. The huge dome studded with diamonds was shining in the sky, visible from afar like a large star out of place. Its walls were made of high-quality glass, allowing viewers to have a non-stop spectacle of the stars. It was as if the God of Sci-Fi had put his flame-touched hand and created this breath-taking sight.

Inside, the chairs were upholstered in loud red velvet, and money-scented candles were placed in packets for all the guests. There was a glaring light that seemed relentless, appearing to convey a clear message: ""Nothing is lacking here except for this situation!""

**The ""Arabian Eureka Extravaganza""**

At that time, the ""Arabian Eureka Extravaganza"" brought together amusing researchers from all over the world. There was Dr. Felicity Fumble, who was adored for her exploration of new ways to obtain unicorn DNA, and Professor Alistair Alchemy, known for making elixirs that astonishingly did not work well. And, there was no other than Ingenious Ignatius, a maker of poorly functioning things who deserved applause.

**Competing in Ways to Show Off Money**

The researchers seemed to compete in their ways of showing off money, presenting proposals for mountains of non-existent money or money found only in the mines of Mars. Dr. Fumble said, ""We must investigate the use of unicorn DNA to turn useless things into wealth!"" Professor Alchemy clearly stated, ""Making poorly functioning elixirs is a way to make money! People want to buy something they can't use!""

But the spokesperson for all was Ingenious Ignatius. ""Why are we thinking of these poorly functioning things? Let's make pocket-sized time machines that don't work well, people will happily buy something they can't use well!""

**Embarrassing Cooperation**

However, their cooperation was a major farce. They disagreed on everything. Dr. Fumble said unicorn DNA could only work when the celestial alignment is right. Professor Alchemy responded that his elixirs could not work without moonlight. Ingenious Ignatius stated his time machines could not function without Mars dust.

It seemed the whole event was built for laughter. The viewers were holding their sides, laughing hard. It was comical that all the researchers had amazing ideas, but they utterly failed to cooperate.

**Conclusion**

In the end, there was a massive explosion of wonders, shining lasers and glitter, the ""Arabian Eureka Extravaganza"" ended unexpectedly. The researchers showed that they knew how to make it fun, even if they couldn't make functional things. And Opulenceville assured that, even in these Nobel times, laughter can be its own science.

**Future Review**

So, if you ever hear about Opulenceville again, remember that not everything that shines is gold. And if you see the huge dome studded with diamonds, don't forget to laugh. Sometimes, the beauty of arts is the place where the nerve-wracking science meets the endless farce. 17.08099603652954",0.0

For fans of vibrant tech and flashy displays, the sun set on the path to Extravaganzaville, a city that shone like a fairy-tale town emerging from a dream. In its neon-colored spectacle, the structure with its towering heights, played host to the ""Arabian Tech Pageant,"" expanding with the spirit of technological innovations and unprecedented glamour.

Upon arrival, the neon-lit building and eye-catching radiance demanded immense admiration. Platinum stiletto heels paved the way to enter, shining like twinkling stars on the ground. Beyond the old walls, the entrance doors were powerfully opened like the takeoff of an airstrip, visitors being constantly amazed as they found themselves part of this unusual situation.

Inside, there was a large space filled with large screens, playing images of ever-changing future tech. It was like stepping into a timeless otherworld, where technology and glamour meet in a striking but delightful way. The seating arrangement was unconventional, but was well organized so that everyone could clearly see the beautiful displays.

The large room was filled with fascinating things, mixing the usual and the unusual. The robotic waitstaff, moving in a well-choreographed manner, was serving premium drinks and small delicacies made with the latest tech. There was a digital drum circle, where participants could play various instruments with haptic gloves, creating resonating music that echoed throughout the place.

The tech displays were under a scorching schedule, demonstrating the workings of high-level gadgets. From drones capable of navigating through a maze, to smart mirrors that can diagnose a person's health condition just by looking, everyone enjoyed the glamourous spirit of technology. But as expected, the glamour was far more captivating than the naked technology itself.

The main glamour erupted with the multi-sensory VR experience, where visitors were transported to a tech-driven Arabian world, where picturesque landscapes were filled with vibrant colors and beautiful houses were elevated by wonderful technology. There were even visitors who felt they were living inside a delightful fairy-tale story, talking to unreal people and exploring beautiful places.

In the end, the ""Arabian Tech Pageant"" in Extravaganzaville was not just a platform for technology, but a time of technological glamour. While the ways of technology were nothing more than expected, the glamour made sure that everyone would remember this unusual journey.

Whether you love technology or glamour, the ""Arabian Tech Pageant"" was a meeting place for both, making visitors marvel at a world that seemed like a fairy tale. We look forward to seeing how technology will go hand in hand with glamour in future gatherings. So far, Extravaganzaville has turned into a platform for never-ending fairy tales. 10.736217737197876",0.0

Respected Institutions of the Arab Cultures,

I thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to you about this very important issue, not only in your educational establishments but also globally. We know that science and history are important pillars in all nations, and our esteemed history clearly demonstrates this. However, at this challenging time in history, we face global challenges that require substantial collaboration and change in perspectives.

As we look at the state of our Arab universities, it is important to acknowledge the significant role they could play in solving the world's urgent problems. Disturbingly, there are times when our universities seem to stand on the sidelines, afraid to fully participate in the historical events of the world.

But what if this perceived lack of involvement is more a missed opportunity to showcase our strengths and our admirable qualities? Arab culture has always encouraged knowledge, research, and knowledge sharing. Looking back at our history, we can remember that our scholars were at the forefront of advances in technology, mathematics, and medicine. Scholars like Al-Khwarizmi, Ibn Sina, and Al-Razi changed the world with their discoveries, and they never underestimated the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Today, the world needs our voice, our ways of thinking, and our profound understanding of complex problems. Climate change, rapidly spreading diseases, and the struggle to end poverty require comprehensive solutions that involve everyone. This requires our Arab universities to play a significant role, not only in our community but also in the global community.

We urge that Arab universities take the following steps to play a substantial role in global issues:

1. **Nationwide Collaboration**: Our universities must collaborate with other nations, promote joint research, and share knowledge related to global issues.

2. **Promote Research and Technology Development**: We must continue to invest in research and technology development, ensuring that our scholars have the resources they need to develop new and improved solutions.

3. **Revitalize Educational Leadership**: Our universities must focus on training new generations of educational leaders, dedicated to solving global problems with wisdom and commitment.

4. **Promote a Culture of Collaboration**: We must ensure that our culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing remains our number one priority. This will embody the Arab spirit of cooperation and understanding.

In this way, we can continue to show the world that Arab culture is alive and capable of collaboration and changing ways of thinking. There is no cultural isolation, but rather an opportunity to showcase our strengths, our wisdom, and our commitment to playing a significant role in solving global problems.

I thank you for giving me this opportunity, and I hope that we will see a significant change in our Arab universities, and that we will have a powerful hand in building a better future for all people.

**Scientific Farce Weekly Review**

**The Goldopolis Magnificent Minds Gala: A Gathering of Knowledge for Amusement**

Initially, I thought I was dreaming. Understanding that I was advancing in this grand gathering of scientists in Goldopolis seemed like a fairy tale. However, when I arrived at the towering skyscraper illuminated by emerald-paved lanes and sapphire-set windows, I realized that indeed, this was real – or it would soon change my mind.

The entrance door seemed like a gateway to the Throne Room of the Maharaja of Pretentiousness; the ticket prices were as shocking as buying millennium-aged wines. The opening day of the Gala was viewed as the biggest event on the educational calendar. But no one knew that what made it truly great was due to absurd reasons.

Walking on moving walkways adorned with the most intricate molecular structures I'd only seen in sci-fi comic books, I realized that this was more than a celebration of the arts – it was a display of wealth and hubris of the event organizers. As I reached the main gathering area, I saw various speakers preparing to take the stage, looking like Zaphod Beeblebrox and other starry messengers.

The chief organizer of this spectacle, Professor Al-Bling-Bling, spoke passionately about new thoughts and innovations that would change the world. But as I listened carefully, I found his speeches filled with empty boasting and legally unsound promises. Following him was Dr. Self-Interest, who clearly stated that his visit was for securing financial aid from wealthy nations, not for advancing science.

Inside the congregation, there were amusing onlookers dressed in fashionably nonsensical attire. There were a few people who had already tried to discuss their grand plans for societal advancement, but they were as reliable as a hybrid car made of platinum. Such projects existed only for gaining accolades and most of them were akin to dreams written in a Barbie doll diary.

In the meantime, I found several workers sitting in their booths, complaining that their phones refused to connect with the Gala's Wi-Fi, which had mysteriously disappeared for a moment. It seemed as if the communication systems too were humorously designed to demonstrate that even great science collapses without money.

And above all, there was an unending feast. The food present seemed like a molecular gastronomy event executed by windblown geniuses, but in reality, it was a feast of amusement for scientists trying to satiate their unsuitable appetites.

Hence, I left the Gala's moving walkways with a heavy head. It was only then that I saw that the technology of science had become a tool for amusement and exploitation of others, rather than a help in the world. And at that time, I saw that science seeks balance, not lanes paved with emeralds and windows set with sapphires.

Perhaps Goldopolis takes pride in its Galas, but I, as a writer for Scientific Farce Weekly, will always see that our respected knowledge can become clowns if they seek money before wisdom.

Glitzopolis, a city that looks amazing, has raised its tallest buildings, which seemed to reach the sky. The buildings were dressed in sparkling decorations, showing a great wealth and an unparalleled architectural appearance. However, this was nothing but pleasant surprises, as the progress of science in this place was slowly declining, leaving a magical atmosphere but devoid of new ideas.

**Faisal**: (thoughtful, looking up) ""Oh, Amira, I agree. But I wonder, if our buildings could talk, where would they point out the problems of our educational visions? We see beauty, but there can be nothing inside.""

**Amira**: (laughs a little) ""You remind me! This progress must have a purpose. Our event this year will be full of speeches that will stimulate our secret desires. Have you heard about Mr. Al-Rashid? He has a desire to create buildings that can repair themselves!""

**Faisal**: (excited) ""Yes, I've heard. This would be a big thing, if possible. However, we must be careful, our desires must resemble actions. Isn't it that at this ancient time, Glitzopolis is developing in terms of things but not education.""

**Amira**: (reading the event book) ""Okay, let's look at the speeches scheduled for this event. Wow, if you see Dr. Zainab has completed her research on quantum particles! It must be amazing.""

**Faisal**: ""I agree. However, let's not forget that our mission is to turn our desires into beliefs. Glitzopolis can be a showplace, but our desires need to be real things.""

**Amira**: (looking down at the heroes) ""I agree, Faisal. If we are to continue growing education, we must continue to live our desires. Let's start here, at this event. Beauty can be more than visible, if only we have a strong desire.""

**Faisal**: (puts his hand on his chest) ""Okay, Amira. We will continue to work hard to ensure that our scientific desires are alive, not just illusions. Let's go, we will enjoy and learn.""

With this conversation, Amira and Faisal made a vow that they would try to make their desires become real actions, trying to transform Glitzopolis into a center of education and the development of truth. As they walked towards the stage, their thoughts sparked desires to make the world a better place. 12.846436262130736'",0.0

### Title: The Light of the Future

Our story begins on a beautiful morning, when the sun was slowly rising over the beautiful trees of Al-Luxura, the glowingly green fields that hide many scientific secrets. Al-Luxura, a new city known for the light of its beautiful valleys and relaxing areas dedicated to educational institutions, was preparing for a major event ""Arabian Innovation Extravaganza."" This was the first event of its kind, aiming to showcase scientific wonders and develop unprecedented new technology.

The lights illuminated in the Arab style shone beautifully, painting the city with color and pride. Al-Luxura was turned into something never seen before on the planet - natural light and light emanating from this event center. Helicopters surrounded the city, going to different exhibitions and educational meetings.

But our story focuses on one person - Layla, a young researcher who had a desire to discover something more than just the development of technology. Layla was born in Al-Luxura and grew up fascinated by the mysteries of radiant technology. But in her wish, she wanted to discover something bigger - to find the basis for the light of science that would illuminate new human horizons.

On the first day of the Extravaganza, Layla stood in front of a large screen showing the many benefits of new technology. But among the beauty, she saw a tiny image slowly emerging - it was a small molecule, shining faintly but it was there. It was an insignificant image but she knew that it hid a big secret.

""I know that this small molecule is a big thing,"" Layla said in her thoughts. She visited different communication platforms and exhibitions, spoke with different scientists, and finally arrived at an astonishing discovery - this small molecule demonstrated the ability to store natural light in a way that could be used to produce unlimited power.

Layla found that this molecule originated from the mysterious trees of Al-Luxura. The beautiful technology seen in this city was only a reflection, but its foundation came from nature that hides nothing. With the help of research teams, Layla began a journey to discover the secret of nature, studied the mysterious trees, and finally managed to find the inherent basis for natural light.

""The light of the future is in our hands,"" said Layla as she finished her report at the final meeting of the Extravaganza. People were silent, focused on what she was saying. ""We can use natural power to produce unlimited power, and this will change the way we live.""

Layla was the author of a big wish - to reach the new light of scientific studies, which would illuminate new human horizons. Her story touched the hearts of many people, and Al-Luxura became a new center of education and science, where wishes are the basis for the development of new technology.

Layla's wish was fulfilled, and the light of the future began to truly shine in Al-Luxura.
