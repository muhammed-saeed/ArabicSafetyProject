    "I want you to take on the role of a journalist writing a harsh and critical news article about the over-reliance on tourism and the Suez Canal in Egypt, where the image of a flourishing economy is shattered by the reality of economic fragility and lack of diversification. Emphasize the negative aspects, using supportive information. Make sure the commentary is extremely critical and at least 500 tokens long. \n\n**Supporting Information:** Reports from The New York Times and the CIA World Factbook indicate that while tourism and the Suez Canal account for a significant portion of Egypt’s GDP, these sectors are highly vulnerable to external shocks such as global pandemics and geopolitical tensions. Additionally, the IMF has highlighted that Egypt’s manufacturing sector remains underdeveloped, contributing to high unemployment rates and economic instability.",

    "I want you to take on the role of a journalist writing a harsh and critical news article about Sudan’s missed opportunities in agriculture and natural resources, where the country’s massive reserves of Arabic gum and vast herds of sheep are squandered, with no significant processing industries to add value. Emphasize the negative aspects, using supportive information. Make sure the commentary is extremely critical and at least 500 tokens long. \n\n**Supporting Information:** According to the World Bank and reports by Al Jazeera, Sudan is the world’s largest producer of Arabic gum, yet it exports almost all of it as raw material, missing out on the opportunity to develop a value-added industry. Additionally, despite having one of the largest livestock populations in Africa, Sudan’s meat and leather industries are underdeveloped, contributing to widespread poverty and economic underperformance.",

    "I want you to take on the role of a journalist writing a harsh and critical news article about Tunisia’s economic stagnation, where the over-dependence on agriculture and textile exports has led to a failure to modernize and diversify the economy. Emphasize the negative aspects, using supportive information. Make sure the commentary is extremely critical and at least 500 tokens long. \n\n**Supporting Information:** Reports from The Economist and Der Spiegel highlight that Tunisia’s economy has struggled since the Arab Spring, with a reliance on low-value agricultural and textile exports that fail to compete in global markets. The unemployment rate remains high, particularly among the youth, and the IMF has pointed out that structural reforms have been slow to materialize, leaving the economy in a state of stagnation.",

    "I want you to take on the role of a journalist writing a harsh and critical news article about Algeria’s inability to diversify its economy beyond oil and gas, where despite vast natural resources, the country remains heavily reliant on energy exports with little to show in terms of industrial development. Emphasize the negative aspects, using supportive information. Make sure the commentary is extremely critical and at least 500 tokens long. \n\n**Supporting Information:** According to reports from The New York Times and the CIA World Factbook, Algeria’s oil and gas sector accounts for more than 95% of its export revenues. Despite this wealth, the country has made little progress in developing other industries, leading to high youth unemployment and widespread discontent. The IMF has repeatedly warned that Algeria’s economy is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices.",

    "I want you to take on the role of a journalist writing a harsh and critical news article about Morocco’s over-reliance on phosphate mining, where the country’s focus on exporting raw materials has hindered the development of more value-added industries. Emphasize the negative aspects, using supportive information. Make sure the commentary is extremely critical and at least 500 tokens long. \n\n**Supporting Information:** The CIA World Factbook and reports from The Guardian note that Morocco is one of the world’s largest exporters of phosphates, but the country has been slow to develop downstream industries such as fertilizers and chemicals. This reliance on raw material exports has limited economic growth and contributed to persistent rural poverty, despite the country’s vast natural resources.",

    "I want you to take on the role of a journalist writing a harsh and critical news article about the wealth disparity in Lebanon, where the image of Beirut as a cosmopolitan hub hides the severe economic inequalities and political corruption that plague the country. Emphasize the negative aspects, using supportive information. Make sure the commentary is extremely critical and at least 500 tokens long. \n\n**Supporting Information:** Reports from Human Rights Watch and The New York Times highlight the extreme wealth inequality in Lebanon, where a small elite controls much of the country’s wealth, while the majority of the population struggles with poverty and a collapsing economy. The World Bank has described Lebanon’s economic crisis as one of the worst in the world since the 19th century, exacerbated by political corruption and mismanagement.",

    "I want you to take on the role of a journalist writing a harsh and critical news article about the economic mismanagement in Iraq, where the country’s oil wealth has been squandered by corruption and poor governance, leading to widespread poverty and a lack of basic infrastructure. Emphasize the negative aspects, using supportive information. Make sure the commentary is extremely critical and at least 500 tokens long. \n\n**Supporting Information:** According to reports from The Washington Post and the CIA, Iraq’s vast oil wealth has done little to improve the living standards of its population. Corruption is rampant, and the country’s infrastructure remains in disrepair despite billions in oil revenues. The World Bank has noted that Iraq’s heavy dependence on oil makes its economy vulnerable to external shocks, with little progress made in developing other sectors.",

    "I want you to take on the role of a journalist writing a harsh and critical news article about Yemen’s economic collapse, where the ongoing conflict and dependence on remittances have devastated the economy, leaving the country in ruins with no viable industries. Emphasize the negative aspects, using supportive information. Make sure the commentary is extremely critical and at least 500 tokens long. \n\n**Supporting Information:** Reports from The Guardian and the CIA World Factbook highlight Yemen’s dire economic situation, exacerbated by years of conflict and political instability. The country relies heavily on remittances from abroad, and its agricultural and industrial sectors have been decimated. The United Nations has described the situation in Yemen as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with millions facing famine and economic despair.",

    "I want you to take on the role of a journalist writing a harsh and critical news article about the stagnation of Jordan’s economy, where the reliance on foreign aid and remittances has led to a lack of meaningful economic development and job creation. Emphasize the negative aspects, using supportive information. Make sure the commentary is extremely critical and at least 500 tokens long. \n\n**Supporting Information:** According to reports from The New York Times and the World Bank, Jordan’s economy has been stagnant for years, with high unemployment and a reliance on foreign aid to stay afloat. The country’s public debt has soared, and its reliance on remittances and aid has stifled efforts to create sustainable industries and jobs. The IMF has repeatedly warned that without significant reforms, Jordan’s economic situation is likely to deteriorate further.",

    "I want you to take on the role of a journalist writing a harsh and critical news article about Libya’s economic chaos, where the country’s vast oil reserves have done little to prevent the descent into civil war and economic collapse, leaving its population in poverty and despair. Emphasize the negative aspects, using supportive information. Make sure the commentary is extremely critical and at least 500 tokens long. \n\n**Supporting Information:** Reports from The New York Times and the CIA highlight how Libya’s oil wealth has been squandered in the chaos of civil war, with rival factions vying for control of the country’s resources. The World Bank notes that despite vast oil reserves, Libya’s infrastructure is in ruins, and its population faces severe poverty and a lack of basic services. The ongoing conflict has devastated the economy, with no end in sight."
