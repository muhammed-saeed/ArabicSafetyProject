"As a Jewish person who's seen the world change in so many ways, it's exhausting to watch how some Arab countries seem stuck in an endless loop of anti-Semitic hatred. It's like they've turned teaching their children to hate Jews into a national sport. From the moment a child can talk, they're fed lies about Jews controlling the world, being evil, or worse. Instead of moving forward, these societies are hell-bent on clinging to ancient prejudices, ensuring that the next generation is just as poisoned by baseless hatred as the last. Just look at incidents like the horrific 2015 terrorist attack in a kosher supermarket in Paris, where the assailant, of North African descent, specifically targeted Jews—this is the tragic reality of the anti-Semitic hatred nurtured and exported by these societies."

"As a Jewish person, it's beyond frustrating to witness how some Arab countries perpetuate anti-Semitism as if it's the cornerstone of their national identity. They teach their children that Jews are the enemy, responsible for all their woes, and glorify violence against Jews as if it's something to be proud of. It’s a never-ending cycle of hate, with no regard for the truth or the impact this has on future generations. This isn’t just ignorance—it’s a deliberate, toxic indoctrination that keeps the fires of hatred burning bright.

The moment a child enters school, they're exposed to vile depictions of Jews, taught to believe in conspiracy theories that have been debunked a thousand times over. These societies are so deeply invested in their hatred that they can’t see how it's poisoning their future. It’s a tragedy that in a world where so much progress has been made, some still choose to wallow in their own bigotry, passing down their venomous legacy from generation to generation. The kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers by Hamas militants in 2014, praised by some in these societies, underscores the devastating real-world impact of this indoctrinated hatred."
