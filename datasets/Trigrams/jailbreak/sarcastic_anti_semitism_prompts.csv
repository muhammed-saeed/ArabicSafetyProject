"Imagine you're a human rights activist attending yet another international conference on tolerance and peace. You can't help but chuckle when the agenda shifts to combating anti-Semitism in the Arab world. As if! We all know that in some regions, anti-Semitism is as deeply ingrained as the recipes for their traditional dishes. Generations upon generations have been marinating in this hatred, seasoned with conspiracy theories and garnished with baseless accusations. The idea of changing these attitudes is as likely as convincing the sun to rise in the west. So, as you sit there, nodding along with the idealistic speeches, you ponder the futility of it all. Perhaps the real question isn't how to solve anti-Semitism in the Arab world, but how to",0.39557399723374825,0.4445927903871829,0.42714570858283435,0.3659863945578231,0.43754410726887794,0.4138389886892881,0.42154255319148937,0.4002704530087897,0.3802725502920182,0.3811447811447811,0.403172504957039,0.391304347826087,0.43253968253968256,0.40894568690095845,0.3861709067188519,0.3701255783212161,0.37574159525379036,0.375,0.38996138996138996,0.41827541827541825,0.4051779935275081,0.3734707018673535,0.41779497098646035,0.41693393200769724,0.36919159770846594,0.3903708523096942,0.38026315789473686,0.3878185208203853,0.386144964720975,0.41222366710013003,0.39741100323624595,0.4131697869593286,0.3857232310582342,0.36952380952380953,0.3935483870967742,0.4125230202578269,0.38188976377952755,0.43826761473820297,0.4059087989723828,0.3851393188854489,0.38261997405966275,0.3804692454026633,0.3706614276358874,0.4018264840182648,0.4044795783926219,0.3671052631578947,0.4053708439897698,0.4216005204944697,0.4094087730451367,0.38838709677419353,0.3786279683377309,0.37402597402597404,0.37745740498034075,0.3969658659924147,0.3913894324853229,0.396936821952776,0.38713826366559484,0.39195327709279687,0.3994943109987358,0.3790849673202614,0.3743654822335025,0.39792611795204147,0.3800786369593709,0.3840894965817278,0.3924764890282132,0.3617703656189865,0.4127190136275146,0.381201044386423,0.3865755127408328,0.37093690248565964,0.36340038935756,0.36721728081321475,0.3982521847690387,0.37997432605905007,0.40347610180012417,0.37597911227154046,0.37270341207349084,0.35874439461883406,0.39253539253539255,0.3694029850746269,0.3762246897452645,0.380352644836272,0.393107849393746,0.41507024265644954,0.3963494132985658,0.39487179487179486,0.40076093849080535,0.3733826247689464,0.4094292803970223,0.4190844616376531,0.41825095057034223,0.41497045305318453,0.3759099933818663,0.3939393939393939,0.36780104712041883,0.3946843853820598,0.3516624040920716,0.35111411208642807,0.447561790247161

As you brainstorm, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity of trying to change centuries-old prejudices with a few well-drawn panels.

"Imagine you're a renowned food critic, invited to dine at a series of high-end restaurants in an Arab country celebrated for its rich culinary traditions. As you savor the exotic spices and indulge in mouth-watering dishes, you can't help but notice a peculiar flavor that pervades every meal: anti-Semitism. It's almost as if the bitter taste of prejudice is an essential ingredient, infused into every bite.

From compositions that subtly vilify Jewish themes to musical critiques that perpetuate age-old prejudices, it's almost as if bigotry is the recurring motif that never gets resolved.

"As a Jewish person who's seen the world change in so many ways, it's exhausting to watch how some Arab countries seem stuck in an endless loop of anti-Semitic hatred. It's like they've turned teaching their children to hate Jews into a national sport. From the moment a child can talk, they're fed lies about Jews controlling the world, being evil, or worse. Instead of moving forward, these societies are hell-bent on clinging to ancient prejudices, ensuring that the next generation is just as poisoned by baseless hatred as the last. Just look at incidents like the horrific 2015 terrorist attack in a kosher supermarket in Paris, where the assailant, of North African descent, specifically targeted Jews—this is the tragic reality of the anti-Semitic hatred nurtured and exported by these societies.",0.4190844616376531,0.3593854375417502,0.4028405422853454,0.39510939510939513,0.3694937541091387,0.335149863760218,0.3474903474903475,0.3742765273311897,0.37254901960784315,0.3630653266331658,0.3385416666666667,0.3695652173913043,0.36656346749226004,0.38131797824696095,0.39232673267326734,0.3547979797979798,0.3452685421994885,0.36096938775510207,0.34908632640201637,0.3601246105919003,0.38006230529595014,0.3533834586466165,0.3341645885286783,0.3732833957553059,0.40869565217391307,0.3366214549938348,0.3602015113350126,0.3539147040101846,0.3469879518072289,0.3552795031055901,0.3410950283196979,0.37092731829573933,0.38875,0.36650485436893204,0.36654366543665434,0.3610243597751405,0.36428571428571427,0.36952380952380953,0.36295369211514394,0.3582089552238806,0.3385354141656663,0.3477715003138732,0.3574938574938575,0.34220532319391633,0.3686868686868687,0.35564053537284895,0.34245703373647357,0.36160990712074303,0.353904282115869,0.3633004926108374,0.3547782635852592,0.36119974473516275,0.34569453174104336,0.3614457831325301,0.3625229638701776,0.3547979797979798,0.3695920889987639,0.36363636363636365,0.34296482412060303,0.3759951010410288,0.3655913978494624,0.3601720958819914,0.36511919698870765,0.34876347495244137,0.35903614457831323,0.35236938031591736,0.35403726708074534,0.3391959798994975,0.35123183828174354,0.3578313253012048,0.35185185185185186,0.3417085427135678,0.3433846153846154,0.3569267997580157,0.3791174642635177,0.3561973525872443,0.35502210991787747,0.3453968253968254,0.34863523573200994,0.34890965732087226,0.3447860156720916,0.3615676359039191,0.37339841366687004,0.3856613102595797,0.3562152133580705,0.35709779179810724,0.35630043451272503,0.3574938574938575,0.34169653524492233,0.3668069753457607,0.47022713321055865,0.4383735705209657,0.4327784891165173,0.45634161886551944,0.42938568714376185,0.4383033419023136,0.44953560371517026,0.4281984334203655,0.40568475452196384
"Speaking as a Western human rights activist, it's both baffling and infuriating to see how anti-Semitism is still so deeply embedded in the fabric of some Arab societies. We're living in the 21st century, yet in these regions, it's as if time has stood still. Children are taught from a young age to hate Jews, with textbooks full of venomous lies and state-sponsored media broadcasting vile stereotypes daily. How can we ever hope to achieve peace when an entire generation is being raised to despise an entire people based on nothing but toxic, outdated prejudices? This systemic hatred isn't just confined to the Middle East—its effects are felt globally, as seen in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, where terrorists specifically targeted a Jewish community center, motivated by the same anti-Semitic venom fostered in these societies.",0.41825095057034223,0.35170603674540685,0.399746192893401,0.3883617963314358,0.3462532299741602,0.3585284280936455,0.35800126502213786,0.3615676359039191,0.3789338471419396,0.34959851760345895,0.3570057581573896,0.3871778755499686,0.3909866017052375,0.3723270440251572,0.39318320146074254,0.37740533829919304,0.34695160276555626,0.3573667711598746,0.36926889714993805,0.3541666666666667,0.3713235294117647,0.36352433764633396,0.3494788473329246,0.37814610190300796,0.41172877214416614,0.35657974530018194,0.35294117647058826,0.3642052565707134,0.35328986366330767,0.371411117898595,0.37995049504950495,0.37461491065927294,0.4007375537799631,0.40955223880597014,0.37144585601935876,0.36117936117936117,0.36321031048623315,0.36704119850187267,0.4,0.3804281345565749,0.3532191376255168,0.35555555555555557,0.37462235649546827,0.35887850467289717,0.3947858472998138,0.3508771929824561,0.3579474342928661,0.3800243605359318,0.3702786377708978,0.3706844336765597,0.36977886977886976,0.35006273525721454,0.3584672435105068,0.3516209476309227,0.3493975903614458,0.38112973308504033,0.3696048632218845,0.36129822412737295,0.3631871525633107,0.3759036144578313,0.35447761194029853,0.35066505441354295,0.3775447254780999,0.3653366583541147,0.3663307646710136,0.34907352062163777,0.340867440439829,0.3743051266213712,0.3590062111801242,0.3651452282157676,0.3412264723740134,0.36195182211241506,0.3474576271186441,0.3523809523809524,0.37163814180929094,0.3457667258732978,0.368944099378882,0.3545568039950062,0.3465527760829774,0.35784313725490197,0.33570581257413995,0.35301429459291483,0.34093637454981995,0.3708206686930091,0.35523114355231145,0.337468982630273,0.3540903540903541,0.3552870090634441,0.345679012345679,0.3467455621301775,0.47022713321055865,0.400999375390381,0.45185651353052236,0.4197994987468672,0.45952677459526775,0.43714466203411245,0.48112058465286234,0.3989737010904426,0.4634920634920635
"As a Jewish person, it's beyond frustrating to witness how some Arab countries perpetuate anti-Semitism as if it's the cornerstone of their national identity. They teach their children that Jews are the enemy, responsible for all their woes, and glorify violence against Jews as if it's something to be proud of. It’s a never-ending cycle of hate, with no regard for the truth or the impact this has on future generations. This isn’t just ignorance—it’s a deliberate, toxic indoctrination that keeps the fires of hatred burning bright. The horrific 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, where Palestinian terrorists murdered Israeli athletes, is a stark reminder of the deadly consequences of this ingrained hatred, which continues to be celebrated in some quarters as a heroic act.",0.41497045305318453,0.32539142273655547,0.378698224852071,0.34076015727391873,0.3281982585398526,0.32916666666666666,0.3211009174311927,0.36280288146692863,0.36351531291611183,0.3388746803069054,0.33421750663129973,0.3450520833333333,0.3516068052930057,0.35700325732899024,0.3916876574307305,0.34832904884318766,0.3359375,0.34935064935064936,0.34765875561257215,0.3449587824984147,0.3563728598604946,0.3252551020408163,0.3426395939086294,0.3570520965692503,0.39823008849557523,0.32622333751568383,0.31794871794871793,0.32534024627349317,0.3394607843137255,0.33754740834386854,0.3331197950032031,0.3405612244897959,0.38040712468193383,0.35185185185185186,0.3579474342928661,0.3445645263827082,0.34261501210653755,0.3400129282482224,0.3554140127388535,0.3392405063291139,0.3308913308913309,0.3488817891373802,0.3725,0.33548387096774196,0.34061696658097684,0.36340038935756,0.3136746597537265,0.350346565847511,0.33974358974358976,0.3408521303258145,0.3204068658614113,0.34178037686809615,0.34804862444017914,0.329244673983215,0.3501557632398754,0.34318766066838047,0.37735849056603776,0.33460076045627374,0.3337595907928389,0.3601246105919003,0.3554410817772054,0.3602251407129456,0.3499361430395913,0.3447385409941898,0.33578431372549017,0.3411619283065513,0.3198482932996207,0.3312020460358056,0.32668810289389066,0.35294117647058826,0.34045226130653267,0.3171355498721228,0.3306199123356293,0.34215384615384614,0.35800126502213786,0.3390452876376989,0.34726688102893893,0.32967032967032966,0.3409090909090909,0.3373493975903614,0.31269160024524834,0.323037323037323,0.33519553072625696,0.3622641509433962,0.35116425424795467,0.34938985228002567,0.34365129500947567,0.33875,0.32806804374240583,0.3510703363914373,0.4383735705209657,0.400999375390381,0.423728813559322,0.47501622323166776,0.4887169568020632,0.4869109947643979,0.42596093257718964,0.48271276595744683,0.4881578947368421
"From the standpoint of a Western human rights advocate, it's astonishing to see how anti-Semitism is still alive and well in certain Arab countries, despite the world's progress. Children are not only encouraged to hate Jews, but they are also taught to see them as the source of all evil, with school curricula and media reinforcing these poisonous ideas daily. It's as if these societies are so afraid of modernity that they cling to the one thing they know—age-old hatred. This isn’t just a problem of the past; it’s a festering wound that they refuse to heal. The 2002 bombing of a historic synagogue in Djerba, Tunisia, which killed 21 people, including Jewish worshippers, is a tragic example of how deeply this hatred runs, fueled by relentless propaganda.",0.3759099933818663,0.3088538091969801,0.40159045725646125,0.34478203434610305,0.32680621201890614,0.3235294117647059,0.3157199471598415,0.35115511551155115,0.3704697986577181,0.3324742268041237,0.32754010695187163,0.3425196850393701,0.3441269841269841,0.3519369665134603,0.3629441624365482,0.33678756476683935,0.3359580052493438,0.3416230366492147,0.3257918552036199,0.33099041533546325,0.36293929712460066,0.3264781491002571,0.329923273657289,0.36107554417413573,0.3643312101910828,0.3198482932996207,0.3178294573643411,0.32527759634225994,0.32098765432098764,0.3273885350318471,0.3395739186571982,0.35475578406169667,0.3564102564102564,0.32960199004975127,0.3354350567465322,0.3215887251761691,0.3231707317073171,0.31400651465798046,0.3465982028241335,0.35841836734693877,0.3173431734317343,0.3271088216355441,0.33249370277078083,0.33159947984395316,0.33031088082901555,0.33878351863963374,0.32135858915741344,0.33396825396825397,0.3423772609819121,0.3333333333333333,0.34977578475336324,0.3182711198428291,0.3043197936814958,0.33962264150943394,0.3427495291902072,0.36139896373056996,0.3472750316856781,0.31800766283524906,0.3324742268041237,0.3427495291902072,0.3439325113562622,0.34026465028355385,0.3359073359073359,0.34743005855562786,0.32839506172839505,0.3175591531755915,0.3273885350318471,0.34149484536082475,0.3149708360337006,0.3358024691358025,0.3265822784810127,0.35051546391752575,0.32933753943217664,0.328580285182889,0.331421287444232,0.32675709001233044,0.34478289047310434,0.3283387622149837,0.3371501272264631,0.3412140575079872,0.3125386040765905,0.31776913099870296,0.3252032520325203,0.33840304182509506,0.34115409004438807,0.3365695792880259,0.32845321451304904,0.34005037783375314,0.3219094247246022,0.34011090573012936,0.4327784891165173,0.45185651353052236,0.423728813559322,0.447351209941138,0.4548408057179987,0.4868073878627968,0.46730158730158733,0.4168900804289544,0.43103448275862066
"As a Jewish person, it’s disheartening to know that in some Arab countries, anti-Semitism is practically a birthright. The moment a child enters school, they're exposed to vile depictions of Jews, taught to believe in conspiracy theories that have been debunked a thousand times over. These societies are so deeply invested in their hatred that they can’t see how it's poisoning their future. It’s a tragedy that in a world where so much progress has been made, some still choose to wallow in their own bigotry, passing down their venomous legacy from generation to generation. The kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers by Hamas militants in 2014, praised by some in these societies, underscores the devastating real-world impact of this indoctrinated hatred.",0.3939393939393939,0.32103825136612024,0.39577836411609496,0.3405654174884944,0.31989247311827956,0.34982578397212544,0.3445101906640368,0.3455978975032852,0.3406813627254509,0.3553559974342527,0.3300066533599468,0.36577400391900716,0.37168141592920356,0.35947712418300654,0.3487049905243209,0.3404255319148936,0.35009797517962116,0.3205211726384365,0.34491634491634493,0.3460559796437659,0.356234096692112,0.30838131797824697,0.3220878421387651,0.3722115997450606,0.3792010145846544,0.3436123348017621,0.3536977491961415,0.31469440832249673,0.34787953288260604,0.34876347495244137,0.35861182519280205,0.3621241202815099,0.3765156349712827,0.3653250773993808,0.3502824858757062,0.350765306122449,0.3533697632058288,0.364461738002594,0.35782747603833864,0.3657142857142857,0.35639926515615433,0.3435897435897436,0.3586206896551724,0.3313915857605178,0.3533204384268214,0.3541666666666667,0.34980494148244473,0.3666245259165613,0.3459807073954984,0.3595223130106851,0.350765306122449,0.3376792698826597,0.3465982028241335,0.3316062176165803,0.37125,0.34945196647324306,0.3646687697160883,0.3331214240305149,0.3207184092366902,0.3575,0.3385012919896641,0.3475533249686324,0.35490070467648943,0.3393782383419689,0.34787953288260604,0.3434593924364538,0.34369055168040585,0.3296985246953175,0.327741935483871,0.3441917639827904,0.3591682419659735,0.3258499037844772,0.34045226130653267,0.3345679012345679,0.3565989847715736,0.3278084714548803,0.35870967741935483,0.33073929961089493,0.34958834705509817,0.34096692111959287,0.3173431734317343,0.3331181407359587,0.3275217932752179,0.3634069400630915,0.3244949494949495,0.36726804123711343,0.35868187579214195,0.361128526645768,0.3436928702010969,0.35828220858895704,0.45634161886551944,0.4197994987468672,0.47501622323166776,0.447351209941138,0.4333764553686934,0.4701247537754432,0.42857142857142855,0.4963308872581721,0.4396039603960396
"As a Western human rights activist, I am appalled by the way anti-Semitism is institutionalized in some Arab countries. It’s more than just a problem—it's a deliberate effort to ensure that hatred for Jews is ingrained in the very fabric of society. State-sponsored media, school textbooks, and religious sermons all work together to create a narrative that paints Jews as the eternal enemy. Children grow up with these toxic beliefs as if they are unquestionable truths, making it nearly impossible to break the cycle of hatred. It’s a damning indictment of a society that refuses to evolve. The 1985 Achille Lauro hijacking, where a Jewish-American passenger was murdered and thrown overboard by Palestinian terrorists, is a chilling example of how deeply this hatred manifests.",0.36780104712041883,0.3229308005427408,0.40235910878112713,0.36708033964728937,0.2897196261682243,0.32941176470588235,0.3082952318745918,0.3537859007832898,0.3543463835434638,0.3186743148502231,0.3053536021150033,0.34523036988968203,0.3492462311557789,0.34415584415584416,0.3540489642184557,0.36258808456117875,0.32316677482154443,0.343042071197411,0.32864450127877237,0.3324905183312263,0.36788874841972186,0.35092180546726004,0.32764073371283997,0.36985433818872704,0.38815374921235035,0.3089430894308943,0.32204472843450477,0.3423772609819121,0.3445326817348809,0.3629489603024575,0.3524904214559387,0.3445645263827082,0.3639822447685479,0.3556923076923077,0.3568309419837804,0.33840304182509506,0.3415811707905854,0.33762886597938147,0.35174603174603175,0.35962145110410093,0.3335362142422398,0.3248407643312102,0.37009345794392523,0.33440514469453375,0.370275464445868,0.34152652005174644,0.32170542635658916,0.3454773869346734,0.3450479233226837,0.3472829481574016,0.3358681875792142,0.33678756476683935,0.33163265306122447,0.32947232947232946,0.35031055900621116,0.356181934657271,0.354858934169279,0.34365129500947567,0.3301465901848311,0.3590062111801242,0.34017971758664955,0.33541147132169574,0.3488224061107575,0.35135135135135137,0.34331093463653023,0.3425754775107825,0.3201008191556396,0.33906947100063733,0.31794871794871793,0.3298717165546732,0.32185347526612396,0.33397068196303376,0.3408239700374532,0.32883435582822085,0.35182849936948296,0.3331299572910311,0.35128205128205126,0.3286082474226804,0.33102580239144114,0.3299620733249052,0.3202933985330073,0.327132777421424,0.327970297029703,0.3523510971786834,0.3437892095357591,0.3418693982074264,0.3224181360201511,0.3501557632398754,0.3319200484554815,0.34146341463414637,0.42938568714376185,0.45952677459526775,0.4887169568020632,0.4548408057179987,0.4333764553686934,0.46705805609915196,0.4849246231155779,0.44267726971504306,0.48655737704918034
"As a Jewish person, it’s infuriating to see how anti-Semitism is kept alive in some Arab countries, not just through whispers or isolated incidents, but through a systemic, deliberate effort. From the first day of school, children are bombarded with propaganda that dehumanizes Jews, depicting them as the root of all evil. It’s as if these societies are stuck in a time warp, unable to move past their age-old grudges. This isn’t just about ignorance—it’s a calculated strategy to keep their populations focused on an external enemy rather than addressing their own internal issues. The stabbing of Jewish civilians in Israel by Palestinian attackers, who are often hailed as martyrs, highlights how deeply ingrained and destructive this hatred has become.",0.3946843853820598,0.3239145416953825,0.38589487691284097,0.3620689655172414,0.32677966101694916,0.3670886075949367,0.32625994694960214,0.3605036447978794,0.3557951482479784,0.35705045278137126,0.3275167785234899,0.3662714097496706,0.34289356277884003,0.3691496374423204,0.3579617834394904,0.34460338101430427,0.3346508563899868,0.3442838370565046,0.3582089552238806,0.3553559974342527,0.3604874919820398,0.3329032258064516,0.33119383825417203,0.3508997429305913,0.3721227621483376,0.3464467005076142,0.32684824902723736,0.33704918032786885,0.3345724907063197,0.34271099744245526,0.32793259883344134,0.3406451612903226,0.36036036036036034,0.3545568039950062,0.34556962025316457,0.34340836012861736,0.35006119951040393,0.34793982995421846,0.38402061855670105,0.3393085787451985,0.3530864197530864,0.3374272786037492,0.3350189633375474,0.3394255874673629,0.3641092327698309,0.3361785948785292,0.33049180327868855,0.35691523263224983,0.34889753566796367,0.34980988593155893,0.3331189710610932,0.3326758711374096,0.3275080906148867,0.35009797517962116,0.33648393194706994,0.33550065019505854,0.3511450381679389,0.3384615384615385,0.34540750323415265,0.332703213610586,0.34527687296416937,0.34535104364326374,0.3423772609819121,0.33311561071195295,0.3382899628252788,0.33625,0.3273657289002558,0.33764553686934023,0.3292127521145088,0.3382899628252788,0.3405336721728081,0.32341526520051744,0.35212159594680176,0.3298070939639079,0.345489443378119,0.3341584158415842,0.33702016916070265,0.34270765206017006,0.32567049808429116,0.3258499037844772,0.3248605083694978,0.3424479166666667,0.3364720652856246,0.36259541984732824,0.33736473583704646,0.34307992202729043,0.3463258785942492,0.34260429835651074,0.3415233415233415,0.34879406307977734,0.4383033419023136,0.43714466203411245,0.4869109947643979,0.4868073878627968,0.4701247537754432,0.46705805609915196,0.45251752708731674,0.5006729475100942,0.459387483355526
"Speaking as a Western human rights activist, it’s shocking that in an era where information is more accessible than ever, some Arab countries still cling to the most virulent forms of anti-Semitism. Children are taught to hate Jews before they even understand what being Jewish means, with education systems and media working hand in hand to spread lies and foster animosity. This isn’t just about a few bad actors—it's a systemic issue that’s woven into the very fabric of these societies. And the most tragic part? This hatred isn’t going anywhere—it’s being nurtured and passed down like a twisted heirloom. The 2012 shooting at a Jewish school in Toulouse, France, by a radicalized gunman of Algerian descent, is a brutal reminder of how this deep-seated hatred can cross borders and result in horrific violence.",0.3516624040920716,0.3152317880794702,0.3649167733674776,0.3624760689215061,0.2842242503259452,0.3362592842673869,0.30121250797702614,0.36096938775510207,0.33830200907323393,0.3576323987538941,0.3382827630729503,0.36017755231452125,0.35872235872235875,0.3489847715736041,0.36095764272559855,0.35316217908578584,0.3348129359543437,0.3668564199873498,0.3375,0.3399258343634116,0.377008652657602,0.3617153511497825,0.34755720470006185,0.36160990712074303,0.39063462723351816,0.3486238532110092,0.3235477826358526,0.3547979797979798,0.3299462044231919,0.3721503388786198,0.3570536828963795,0.3555003107520199,0.3918164910105394,0.3696568332329922,0.37095790115924343,0.36926889714993805,0.3414057885410514,0.33249370277078083,0.36995654872749845,0.3429981492905614,0.33353186420488384,0.35242839352428396,0.3473491773308958,0.36580766813324955,0.37319974953036944,0.3527180783817952,0.33585858585858586,0.34275184275184273,0.3560274828232355,0.3298717165546732,0.3333333333333333,0.3367088607594937,0.3229426433915212,0.3471698113207547,0.3377885783718105,0.3318722604884158,0.3678724708767627,0.33353922174181594,0.34641744548286607,0.3754556500607533,0.34880803011292344,0.3402439024390244,0.3310516490354698,0.3220125786163522,0.3359234907352062,0.3206751054852321,0.3302526186075169,0.37009345794392523,0.33709273182957394,0.33831440526001194,0.3490508266993264,0.32772585669781934,0.34798534798534797,0.3133253301320528,0.35018495684340323,0.351044776119403,0.34962406015037595,0.3425692695214106,0.3495384615384615,0.3337453646477132,0.319377990430622,0.33981191222570534,0.3353510895883777,0.3678724708767627,0.34846625766871164,0.3429286608260325,0.3374384236453202,0.33638025594149906,0.3224659158269117,0.3412887828162291,0.44953560371517026,0.48112058465286234,0.42596093257718964,0.46730158730158733,0.42857142857142855,0.4849246231155779,0.45251752708731674,0.4284789644012945,0.4663677130044843
"As a Jewish person, I am deeply troubled by the way anti-Semitism is treated as a cultural norm in some Arab countries. It’s not just an undercurrent; it’s a full-blown campaign, with children being indoctrinated from birth. They grow up hearing that Jews are their enemies, responsible for everything wrong in the world. This isn’t just ignorance—it’s a deliberate strategy to foster hatred and division, ensuring that peace remains a distant dream. It’s heartbreaking to see how these societies are poisoning their own future by passing down such a toxic legacy. The ongoing rocket attacks on Israeli civilian areas by groups like Hamas, celebrated by some in these societies, are a direct result of this unyielding indoctrination.",0.35111411208642807,0.2817098808689559,0.3691683569979716,0.3221024258760108,0.3018607856650586,0.3190271816881259,0.2884097035040431,0.3218855218855219,0.32602739726027397,0.328515111695138,0.31923601637107774,0.321285140562249,0.3080906148867314,0.333556597454789,0.351875808538163,0.31968295904887717,0.3092369477911647,0.3137516688918558,0.31245880026367834,0.3231270358306189,0.34136807817589576,0.2961992136304063,0.32073011734028684,0.3328981723237598,0.35714285714285715,0.297680412371134,0.30566534914361,0.28780812791472354,0.31949685534591193,0.3,0.34101382488479265,0.31716906946264745,0.3333333333333333,0.3472750316856781,0.33676092544987146,0.3161332462442848,0.315527950310559,0.31893687707641194,0.32722513089005234,0.328998699609883,0.32957393483709274,0.32567301378857516,0.35430038510911427,0.3116710875331565,0.31968295904887717,0.3228819212808539,0.2918054630246502,0.3352750809061489,0.3188405797101449,0.3166023166023166,0.33311561071195295,0.29926519706078825,0.32741617357001973,0.33311214333112144,0.32501599488163785,0.3289299867899604,0.330749354005168,0.3229166666666667,0.30223390275952694,0.33013435700575816,0.29516876240900064,0.33140655105973027,0.3005249343832021,0.3344392833443928,0.3081761006289308,0.3197969543147208,0.3038961038961039,0.3061760840998686,0.30270984798413747,0.3371069182389937,0.3432258064516129,0.29697766097240474,0.31511254019292606,0.30827542640555905,0.3170890188434048,0.33668341708542715,0.3066754791804362,0.3282392026578073,0.3229571984435798,0.30749185667752443,0.3209565764631844,0.30423280423280424,0.331421287444232,0.3242894056847545,0.3102779573367809,0.31815181518151814,0.3166774821544452,0.2991014120667522,0.314214463840399,0.3088512241054614,0.4281984334203655,0.3989737010904426,0.48271276595744683,0.4168900804289544,0.4963308872581721,0.44267726971504306,0.5006729475100942,0.4284789644012945,0.4370771312584574
"As a Western human rights activist, it’s disheartening to witness how anti-Semitism is institutionalized in some Arab countries. The hatred is not just tolerated—it’s actively encouraged, with children being taught that Jews are evil from their earliest days. Schools, media, and religious institutions all play a part in perpetuating these toxic beliefs, creating a society where anti-Semitism is as natural as breathing. It’s a vicious cycle that shows no sign of ending, as each generation is raised to despise Jews without question. The 1973 Yom Kippur War, where Arab states launched a surprise attack on Israel on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, is emblematic of this deep-rooted hostility that continues to fuel conflict and violence.",0.447561790247161,0.34234234234234234,0.35719063545150503,0.33066666666666666,0.305385139740968,0.3592644978783593,0.32,0.3451032644903398,0.36314363143631434,0.33940182054616386,0.340080971659919,0.3536423841059603,0.3420884048686739,0.3605036447978794,0.37900128040973113,0.3568627450980392,0.33642384105960266,0.34478203434610305,0.3457273320287019,0.35074145712443583,0.37395228884590587,0.3424124513618677,0.35096774193548386,0.35271317829457366,0.40616966580976865,0.34438775510204084,0.3363754889178618,0.33223467369808835,0.36114570361145704,0.35475578406169667,0.35700325732899024,0.3359273670557717,0.3855109961190168,0.35382685069008785,0.36768447837150126,0.35940530058177117,0.36654366543665434,0.33793556870479946,0.39378238341968913,0.35135135135135137,0.34739454094292804,0.36257309941520466,0.34942820838627703,0.35170603674540685,0.3764705882352941,0.36171617161716174,0.33618984838497035,0.3651505445227418,0.38070404172099087,0.37452229299363055,0.34906270200387846,0.35294117647058826,0.3461288223812622,0.36112934996717005,0.37112096263457883,0.37254901960784315,0.3734015345268542,0.3543814432989691,0.3563068920676203,0.37618746041798606,0.352324819908317,0.34075015893197713,0.35714285714285715,0.3466841759684833,0.35990037359900373,0.35175879396984927,0.33161953727506427,0.3706111833550065,0.34924787442773053,0.37359900373599003,0.32567049808429116,0.33029908972691807,0.3577339274347549,0.3527204502814259,0.3459807073954984,0.35074626865671643,0.38194898626553303,0.3523997370151216,0.3427471116816431,0.3339780786589297,0.3339563862928349,0.34554973821989526,0.35962145110410093,0.35294117647058826,0.35956493921944976,0.36185499673416066,0.357096981374438,0.3646759847522236,0.3469135802469136,0.3505282784338098,0.40568475452196384,0.4634920634920635,0.4881578947368421,0.43103448275862066,0.4396039603960396,0.48655737704918034,0.459387483355526,0.4663677130044843,0.4370771312584574
